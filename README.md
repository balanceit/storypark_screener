## Question 1
### Whatâ€™s your proudest achievement?

During my time with with Loyalty NZ we ran into a problem when handling backdated transactions (someone buying something, not the db kind).  The problem was how to correctly calculate the amount of loyalty points (AirNZ dollars, New world dollars, FlyBy points, etc.) when the current point to dollar exchange rate may have changed since the point of time of these backdated transactions. At times the calculations were run weeks after the actual transaction had taken place.

In order to overcome this problem I introduced the concept of 'Effective dating' resources in our API. By using a combination of database (PostgreSQL) triggers and ActiveRecord mixins this issue was solved with minimal rewrite to the existing API implementation.

I wrote database migration generators to create the triggers and additional tables and assisted in the design and review of the Active record mixins.

I am quite proud of this work because I was able to implement a solution which could be generically applied, prevented the necessity for a rewrite of a substantial portion of the points calculation and transaction code base and was to this in a way which resulted in minimal computational overhead.

## Question 2
### What's the most interesting technical article you've read recently? What did you like about it and why should we take a look at it?

While working on implementing a content based recommendation system for MBIE recently I came across an article (see below) written by Alyona Medelyan, a graduate of the University of Waikato, about automatic keyword extraction.  I liked this article because it was written in a clear and approachable way, it contain all the source code and helped me better understand the problem I with which I was tackling.  In in the end I didn't end up implementing the RAKE algorithm to assist in the recommendation system but it was helpful and interesting nonetheless.

After watching the demo video of the Storypark application I thought about how each story can be associated with one or more "Learning Tags". This made me think of a way in which as a story is being written suggestions can be made about which Learning Tags to apply to this story.  A text's keywords can be part of the input to a recommendation system.  The RAKE algorithm is a straightforward way to get these keywords.
